# MRIDataPreprocessing
This repository explores preprocessing techniques for T1-weighted MRI scans, focusing on denoising, masking, and skull stripping using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It also evaluates the preprocessing pipeline on various structural MRI datasets, including T1 from open datasets used in the Coursera NeuroHacking in R course.
